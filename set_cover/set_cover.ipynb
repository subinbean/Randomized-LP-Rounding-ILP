    "## Implementation\n",
    "Notice that all the implementation details are abstracted away in set_cover.py. Here, we are able to interact with the SetCover object imported from set_cover.py which has two convenient methods solveILP() and solveLP_Rounding() that we can interact with. Both take in a dataset that contains the set cover problem. The dataset should be of the format m (number of elements), n (number of sets), the cost of each set c(i) where i = 1...n, and for each element j = 1...m the number of sets that cover element j as well as the sets that cover j. Note that in our implementation, for ease, we often use 0-indexing for storage and switch to 1-indexing when interacting with the data. All of this is abstracted away however."
